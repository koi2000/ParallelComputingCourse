- Design a parallel algorithm to find the **approximate** K-nearest neighbors (e.g., K=10) of each element given the coordinates of N points (e.g., N=20000) in D-dimensional space (e.g., D=64).
- Implement the algorithm with OpenMP and submit (only) your program. Please see the provided source codes as a starting point.
